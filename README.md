pdfListView
===========

*This is work in progress.*

A simple list view to render a PDF document using PDF.JS.

# Run locally

Some browsers (like Chrome) need to load the `index.html` file using a local web server. This can easily done by installing the dev-dependencies:

```
$> npm install
```

Starting the server is done by executing:

```
$> grunt server
```

This will start a local web server on port 9996. To server the index.html, point your browser at http://localhost:9996/.
